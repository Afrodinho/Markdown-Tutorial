#What is Markdown

Markdown is a plaintext editor that has formatting abilities. If you've already had the opportunity to edit a document in markdown you might've already noticed that it looks just like a TextEdit on Mac or Notepad on Windows

So for instance I had to use GitHub to post this tutorial but I don't really like the way I cannot see how something looks live as I am typing it. I just see it like a plain text. So I usually use another website to create what I want and copy to GitHub.
