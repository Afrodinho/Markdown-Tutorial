#What is Markdown

[Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)


So for instance I had to use GitHub to post this tutorial but I don't really like the way I cannot see how something looks live as I am typing it. I just see it like a plain text. So I usually use another website to create what I want and copy to GitHub.
