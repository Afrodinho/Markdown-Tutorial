# How to Embed Photos

Embedding photos on markdown can be tricky. You might think you could just drag and drop you photo right where you wanted. But you shouldn't always. Here are a few ways you can Embed a photo

### Via a Link

The easiest and probably most common way to embed a photo is via a link. If you want to use a photo found on the internet you can use the comamand: 

```
<img src="Link" width ="Size"> 

OR

![Link]

```
I use the first code when I care about the image size. I use the second one whenever I do not care about the image size.

You can also upload images into your github repository and link them if you don't have a place for them. I usually add them all in a thread in issues.

### Drag and drop

I believe this only works on github but you can drag a photo (or any file) by dragging the image into the file you want.
