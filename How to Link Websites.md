# How to Link Websites

If you're here you alreday know how to navigate the internet pretty well. You probably already know the first way.

#### Paste the Link

You know that you can copy a link in most places and are able to paste the full web address. Like this: https://www.apple.com

#### Embed the Link

Embeding a link is putting a link behind any given word or phrase. It makes your page look much better when viewed. [Here](https://www.apple.com) is an example of an embedded link. See how "here" is blue? That means that word links to another place.

Here is how you do it.
```
[word or phrase](Link)

```

This is usefull for linking to other pages while still conveying a message.
