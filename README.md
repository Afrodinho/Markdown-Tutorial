# Markdown Tutorial
I am going to teach you how to use Markdown!

Hi My name is Kaden! In the Spring semester of 2021 I was enrolled in the Digital Systems class at the University of Missouri. For our finally project we are using Github and Markdown to create a tutorial. I thought it would be useful to create a tutorial on how to use Markdown since it can be a little confusing. I hope you find this helpful!

Follow the links at the bottom of the page to naviagate through the tutorial.
