# Markdown Tutorial
I am going to teach you how to use Markdown!

Hi My name is Kaden! In the Spring semester of 2021 I was enrolled in the Digital Systems class at the University of Missouri. For our final project we are using Github and Markdown to create a tutorial. I thought it would be useful to create a tutorial on how to use Markdown since it can be a little confusing.My hope is to show people who learn best by reading a simple way to learn some Markdown. I hope you find this helpful!

Follow the links at the bottom of the page to naviagate through the tutorial.
